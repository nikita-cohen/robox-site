                        use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use

                        instructions provided by your device manufacturer. However, we provide the following information
                        solely for informational purposes.

                    If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of targeted advertising by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher,
                    and setting "Limit Ad Tracking" to "ON". You can do this by clicking on Settings -> Privacy ->
                    Advertising, and toggling "Limit Ad Tracking" to "ON". This prevents apps that you use from using your
                    Apple device’s Advertising Identifier to serve you targeted ads. In addition, or as an alternative, you
                    may reset your device’s Advertising Identifier, which will result in your device being disassociated
                    from ad targeting profiles based on the Advertising Identifier in effect prior to reset. You can do this
                    by clicking on Settings -> Privacy -> Advertising -> Reset Advertising Identifier. Again, you should
                    consult Apple’s support web pages and instructions for the most current applicable settings. If you have
                    an Android device, you can opt out of targeted advertising on your device. You can do this by clicking
                    the menu icon to display the apps list, then find and select the Google Settings icon, then find and
                    select "Ads" and check the box "Opt out of interest-based ads". In addition, or as an alternative, you
                    may reset your device’s Android advertising ID, which will result in your device being disassociated
                    from ad targeting profiles based on the Android advertising ID in effect prior to reset. You can do this
                    by clicking the menu icon to display the apps list, then find and select the Google Settings icon, then
                    find and select "Ads" and selecting "Reset advertising ID". Note that Android settings menus may vary
                    among device manufacturers and these instructions may not be accurate for your device. You should
                    consult Google’s settings and instructions for the most current settings information.
