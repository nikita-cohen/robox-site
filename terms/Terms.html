                    By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you –
                    you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to
                    copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to
                    attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into
                    other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
                    database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Roblominer.

                    Roblominer is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that
                    reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and
                    for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you
                    exactly what you’re paying for.

                <div class="desc-txt-terms">
                    The Roblominer app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide
                    our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
                    recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software
                    restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your
                    phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it
                    could mean that the Roblominer app won’t work properly or at all.

                <div class="desc-txt-terms">
                    You should be aware that there are certain things that Roblominer will not take responsibility for.
                    Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection
                    can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Roblominer cannot take responsibility for
                    the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of
                    your data allowance left.
                </div>
                <div class="desc-txt-terms">
                    If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
                    agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
                    mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                    other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges,
                    including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or
                    country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                    using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for
                    using the app.

                <div class="desc-txt-terms">
                    Along the same lines, Roblominer cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You
                    need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to
                    avail the Service, Roblominer cannot accept responsibility.

                <div class="desc-txt-terms">
                    With respect to Roblominer’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s
                    important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all
                    times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you.
                    Roblominer accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
                    wholly on this functionality of the app.

                <div class="desc-txt-terms">
                    At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the
                    requirements for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app
                    to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Roblominer
                    does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the
                    Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to
                    the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use
                    of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
                    termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using
                    the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.
